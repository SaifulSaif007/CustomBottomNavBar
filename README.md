                    navController.navigate(item.route) {
                        popUpTo(navController.graph.startDestinationId) {
                            saveState = true
                        }
                        launchSingleTop = true
                        restoreState = true
                    }
                },
                activeColor = Color.Cyan,
                inactiveColor = Color.Gray,
                // Other custom styling as needed
            )
        }
    ) {
        Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
